As a medical student, you have to do a lot of things you don't want to. Regardless of what you're interested in, you have to deliver 10 babies and know all the bones and muscles of the foot before someone decides you can be a doctor. Medical school can feel like a huge, multi-year tick-boxing exercise, and It's easy to get lost in the exams and the competition without really knowing what you want out of your career. 

## The mind likes defined structures and predictable paths.

Graduating medical school is usually when people go wrong. They stick to the "prescribed path" without realizing that when it comes to figuring out what you want your career to look like, there isn't really one. What helps people succeed in the structured environment at university doesn't serve really serve them well when it comes to finding fulfilling work.

What happens if you don't adjust? You end up clinging to things that "a high achiever is supposed to do". I've seen a fair few smart, driven doctors burn out because they ended up doing PhDs in things they didn't care about, or take on responsibilities they didn't enjoy because they felt they had to. 

If I had stuck to the traditional paths, I would have never discovered my passion for digital health and found the courage to pursue it.

## The principle - Don't do things out of a sense of obligation.

The one principle that helped me figure out my path was to be **keenly aware of when I was doing things out of a sense of obligation.** Whenever I did things out of a sense of obligation, I found it created resentment and entitlement. Instead of just doing things because you want to, doing things because you "should", or because you expect a certain outcome, is how you'll end up doing something you never wanted to do. All whilst not having fun along the way. 

Sometimes we have to do things we don't want to. That's a fact of life. For those things that you truly have no way of getting around, even being aware of a sense of obligation can help you reframe the task into an "I want to". You can find the learning in it and enjoy the process, even if it's something like an interview or an exam. 

That being said, if you can't shake the feeling, and you find yourself spending a disproportionate amount of your time and energy on things you're not enjoying, it's time to rethink your path. 

The advice I would give to my younger self is to remember that you have a long career ahead of you. The game is really to figure out what you want to make of it, and not to keep achieving for the sake of it. What got you here won't get you to where you need to be, and it's going to take some courage to listen to yourself.
